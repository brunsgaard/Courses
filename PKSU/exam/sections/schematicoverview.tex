Overall our planning and initial scheduling for the project has been good. 
We have been good at discussing realistic estimates for specific tasks. 
In some ways it was an advantage that Subsea7 is located in Stavanger, because from the start of the project, we were forced to figure out flight dates etc. Thus a detailed schedule was made early in process.
