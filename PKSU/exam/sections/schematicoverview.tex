Overall our planing and initial scheduling for the project has been good. 
We have been good at discussing realistic durations for specific tasks. 
In some way it has been an advantage, that Subsea7 is located in Stavanger, 
because we had to flight to the meetings, thus postponement of meetings have not 
been and option.
Thus, from the start of the project we have been forced to make a detailed schedule.
