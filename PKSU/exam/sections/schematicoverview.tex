Overall our planing and initial scheduling for the project has been good. 
We have been good at discussing realistic durations for specific tasks. 
In some ways it has been an advantage, that Subsea7 is located in Stavanger, 
because we from that start of the project have been forced to figure out flight dates 
etc, and thus a detailed schedule was made eairly in the process.
