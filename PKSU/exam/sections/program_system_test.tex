Automated tests have been performed on the code using the NUnit framework included
with Monotouch. The testing has been randomized to ensure that all edge cases are properly
tested. A test server has also been created to serve randomly generated and updated test
data for manual testing purposes. The tests run in the iOS Simulator and on iOS devices,
to ensure correct behaviour on the target platform.

For more information, and the complete test specifications, please see Appendix A-D.
