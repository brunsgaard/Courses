\section{FACTOR}

FACTOR (as mentioned in \cite{factor}) is used in this project to
formulate a system definition. From the last FACTOR system definition
in sub-report 2, we mentioned that as the project at the time was far
from completion, the FACTOR definition was subject to change.

As the FACTOR system definition did not in fact need any changes, the
following paragraphs contain the same FACTOR as contained in
sub-report 2.

\begin{description}
\item[Function] \hfill \\ Enable employees to quickly and effortlessly
  locate another employee in the company, either by name, project or
  department.
\item[Application domain] \hfill \\ Company employee finder.
\item[Conditions] \hfill \\ Usable without requiring any prior
  knowledge (highly intuitive). No discernible delays when using the
  application, no matter the condition.
\item[Technology] \hfill \\ Target platform is an Apple iPad 2, while
  enabling easy porting of the application to other, highly similar,
  target (e.g. iPhone). Specifically, the application should be
  written in C\#. Backend is highly irrelevant, with the only
  restriction that the data should be delivered in XML format
  validating against our XML Schema Definition.
\item[Objects] \hfill \\ Employees, departments, projects.
\item[Responsibility] \hfill \\ Automatic updates of data.
