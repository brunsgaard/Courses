\section{Suggestions for improvement}
One thing we have learned from this course, is that software development requires many iterations,
and thus one have to be aware, not to approach the result from the design, analyze or implementation
as finale, but rather as running evaluation. The boot seams to agree "a project plan is
developed iterativly"\cite{oose} p.698 and also in \cite{mad-article} s.23 fig 7.

Also we would have been able to improve the project process, if we had been better to set demands
for deadline and informations from Subsea7. We felt, that we "needed" Subsea7, more than
they needed us, and thus we have been reluctant, with demands. This way we would have been able
to get a more comprehensive specification requirement, earlier in the process, which would have
saved us some code. Also we would have been completely done at this point, if Subsea7 have had
their xml-feed service ready in time. To hold our deadlines we have been using a scrum-like
organization model \cite{oose} p. 647, and we have had great success with this model. Thus we will
suggest other devlopment teams to check out this model.

As mentioned earlier, our project is 95 pct. done and subsea7 is pleased with the result, and so are we.
Furthermore there have been only minor problems in the planing and development process. I think we
did a good job, and looking back i don't see other things that we could have done (but not did),
to improve the planing and the development process.
