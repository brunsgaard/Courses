The current results of the automated tests show that both the model handlers and the data source
conforms to our specifications on the target platform. Future tests will focus on expanding the
randomization of tests to ensure that all possible edge cases are covered. A future test focus will
also be the Parser. Tests for this subsystem have thus far been based on the randomized test server,
and verified manually. We wish to generate a static test set that we can test the functionality against.
This ensures that all output from the parser conforms to all expectations for the data.
