\section{Strength and weekness's in the planing}
    I find that we as an developemnt team have had a reasonable allocation of
    the different parts in the developmentprocess. In the group we have been
    good at continuous evaluation, at our weekly monday meetings and also we
    have distributed responsibily as it is mentioned in \cite{oose} s. 113.
    This has been very importent because we have been able to react and adjust
    the schedule when new and better implementation ideas have come to the
    table or unforeseen changes has occured.

    Subsea7 has been a good and reliable business partner in this project, but
    the planing regarding the webservice they should deliver has not been
    optimal. They are very busy and it would have been good for the project, if
    they earlier in the process would have known how they would like to  serve
    updates to the ipads. Because we did not, know how they would serve updates
    we made the system way to advanced, so it would be able to handle
    incemental updates. If we from the start had known, that they did not
    intend to serve incemental updates, we would have had a better idea how to
    analyse and design the application correct earlier in the process.

    In the allocation of resources I also find, that we have had a far too
    linear approch to analyse, design and implementation, instead of the
    approach described in \cite{mad-article} s. 23 (see figure 7). When we
    finised the first revision of the analyse, design og implemtation we
    thought of it as more or less finale. And only later in the process we
    realised that many revisions were needed to come up with an optimal
    solution. So it would have been better to do analyse, design and
    implemtation more losely, and then repeat the process instead of trying to
    get it perfect the first time.
