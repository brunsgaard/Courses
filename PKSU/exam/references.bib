    abstract = {Software Engineers have been searching for the ideal
                  software development process: a process in which
                  programs are derived from specifications in the same
                  way that lemmas and theorems are derived from axioms
                  in published proofs. After explaining why we can
                  never achieve it, this paper describes such a
                  process. The process is described in terms of a
                  sequence of documents that should be produced on the
                  way to producing the software. We show that such
                  documents can serve several purposes. They provide a
                  basis for preliminary design review, serve as
                  reference material during the coding, and guide the
                  maintenance programmer in his work. We discuss how
                  these documents can be constructed using the same
                  principles that should guide the software
                  design. The resulting documentation is worth much
                  more than the "afterthought" documentation that is
                  usually produced. If we take the care to keep all of
                  the documents up-to-date, we can create the
                  appearance of a fully rational design process.},
