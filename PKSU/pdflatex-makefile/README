Simple Makefile for typesetting papers using pdflatex.

Features:
 - Simple to use: just set TARGET=<yourpaper> and 'include Makefile.include'.
   See the 'example' directory for a usage example.
 - Calculates dependencies sanely.  Detects changes to included .tex and .bib
   files and rebuilds when appropriate.
 - Detects your revision control system (svn, git, hg) and defines a
   '\Revision' command you can use in your LaTeX markup to include a current
   revision identifier.  Useful for circulating drafts for comment.
 - 'make view' opens your typeset document.
