The information below is all found in the java docs.
_______________________________
**Java.util.Stack **

Pros:	* Based on vectors and therefore offer synchronized access(thread safe)

Cons:	* Because it is based on vectors any element in the stack can be accessed, 
		  not just the top one.
		  
		* Its a Class and not an interface. (locked to one implementation)


**  The use of an ArrayList **

Pros:	* Easy to implement (compared to LinkedLists)
		* Maginal faster that vectors (Java.util.Stack)

Cons:	* Push operation is amortized constant time.


**  The use of an LinkedList **

Pros:	* Does not use dynamic arrays, so there are no need to reallocate memory.
		* All operations on the stack is constant time.

Cons:	* Is not synchronized and therefore there for it is not thread safe, thus
		  it can't be used conveniently in multi thread programming.
