Assignment 2.9

1.	I would create a method getProfileAsString in the Person class, which return a 
	string containing the relevant information. 

2.	I would create a method showProfiles in DikuPlus which took the HashMap network
	and used a for loop to go through every profile
	
	e.g:
		    public void showProfiles() {
				for (Person person : network.values())
	   				 System.out.println(person.getProfileAsString());
   			}
